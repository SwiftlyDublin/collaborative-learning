<p>Apple's Swift programming language, introduced in the summer of 2014, is the new way in which iOS and OSX applications will be written. This collaoration group is to help llearn the language ans some of the new toolkits and frameworks.  </p>

<p>Our aim is to have co-located, collaborative learning.  So the participants will meet weekly, in one location working on a theme.  The theme may be a language feature, a framework or an interesting problem.</p>

<p>The session are organised into these themes, with a specific organiser per theme whose job it is to pull together the exercises and direct the session.  The organiser may not a swift eexpert but this way we can all learn together.</p>

<p>The result of attending this session is to have comfort in programming Swift with the ability to create an application.</p>

<p>Below is only a proposed set of activites, please share and if there are any volunteers for organising a session, please sign up.</p>

<p>We must also prepare ourselves for many Taylor Swift jokes, they seem part of the territory.</p>

<a name="coaches" class="anchor" href="#coaches"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Call for Coaches, Runners and Session Owners</h1>

We are looking for assistance during the running of these <a href="#the-sessions">sessions</a>.<p>
<ul>
  <li>Coaches.  We need people with some Swift or Cocoa experience to act as coaches during the sessions to help the participants as they work through exercises.  We can offer kind words, a fun environment, and maybe, just maybe, a beer.<p>
    
  <li> Runners.  For the <a href="#the-sessions">sessions</a>, there is a need for <i>runners</i>, people who can work on a section of sesion, maybe code examples and present them.<p>
    <li> Session Owners. A session owner looks after the content of the session and works with the runners to produce a working set of exercise.  We have a number of sessions, and some do not have session owners, if  <a href="#the-sessions">any of these </a> are of interest, please <a href="http://twitter.com/SwiftlyDublin">let us know</a>. <p>
</ul>

<p>This is a far more formalised list of roles than what is experienced during the sessions, but having even designes will help get better content for them. <p>
