{"name":"collaborative-learning","tagline":"Meeting Weekly since October 2014 to learn Swift, Apple's Programming Language","body":"# Collaborative Learning \r\n\r\nApple's Swift programming language, introduced in the summer of 2014, is the new way in which iOS and OSX applications will be written. This collaoration group is to help llearn the language ans some of the new toolkits and frameworks.  \r\n\r\nOur aim is to have co-located, collaborative learning.  So the participants will meet weekly, in one location working on a theme.  The theme may be a language feature, a framework or an interesting problem.\r\n\r\nThe session are organised into these themes, with a specific organiser per theme whose job it is to pull together the exercises and direct the session.  The organiser may not a swift eexpert but this way we can all learn together.\r\n\r\nThe result of attending this session is to have comfort in programming Swift with the ability to create an application.\r\n\r\nBelow is only a proposed set of activites, please share and if there are any volunteers for organising a session, please sign up.\r\n\r\nWe must also prepare ourselves for many Taylor Swift jokes, they seem part of the territory.\r\n\r\nTwitter account: @SwiftlyDublin, https://twitter.com/SwiftlyDublin\r\nEventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/learning-the-swift-programming-language-swiftlydublin-tickets-13659360515 \r\nThis page, shortened goo.gl/GbEj9b\r\n\r\n# The Sessions\r\n\r\nThis is a rough schedule:\r\n\r\n1.
